         In Software development for example,it is always a good practise to have
         a mentor.Someone you lok up to will always have more information and help you out anytime you are stuck.

           software craftsman all around.He plays an important role in my motivation since he pioneered Free speech and was
           pushing towards free distribution of information at the time of his untimely death.
